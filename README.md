## About The Project

VoxCPM is a novel tokenizer-free Text-to-Speech system that redefines realism in speech synthesis by modeling speech in a continuous space. Built on the MiniCPM-4 backbone, it excels at generating highly expressive speech and performing accurate zero-shot voice cloning.

This custom node handles everything from model downloading and memory management to audio processing, allowing you to generate high-quality speech directly from a text script and optional reference audio files.

**‚ú® Key Features:**
*   **Context-Aware Expressive Speech:** The model understands text context to generate appropriate prosody and vocal expression.
*   **True-to-Life Voice Cloning:** Clone a voice's timbre, accent, and emotional tone from a short audio sample.
*   **Zero-Shot TTS:** Generate high-quality speech without any reference audio.
*   **Automatic Model Management:** The required VoxCPM model is downloaded automatically and managed efficiently by ComfyUI to save VRAM.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Adjust parameters like CFG scale and inference steps to tune the performance and style of the generated speech.
*   **High-Efficiency Synthesis:** VoxCPM is designed for speed, enabling fast generation even on consumer-grade hardware.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to install is via **ComfyUI Manager**. Search for `ComfyUI-VoxCPM` and click "Install".

Alternatively, to install manually:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory and clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/wildminder/ComfyUI-VoxCPM.git
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate into the cloned `ComfyUI-VoxCPM` directory, and install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    cd ComfyUI-VoxCPM
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Start/Restart ComfyUI:**
    Launch ComfyUI. The "VoxCPM TTS" node will appear under the `audio/tts` category. The first time you use the node, it will automatically download the selected model to your `ComfyUI/models/tts/VoxCPM/` folder.

## Models
This node automatically downloads the required model files.

| Model | Parameters | Hugging Face Link |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| VoxCPM-0.5B | 0.5B | [openbmb/VoxCPM-0.5B](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/VoxCPM-0.5B) |

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Add Nodes:** Add the `VoxCPM TTS` node to your graph. For voice cloning, add a `Load Audio` node to load your reference voice file.
2.  **Connect Voice (for Cloning):** Connect the `AUDIO` output from the `Load Audio` node to the `prompt_audio` input on the VoxCPM TTS node.
3.  **Write Text:**
    *   For **voice cloning**, provide the transcript of your reference audio in the `prompt_text` field.
    *   Enter the text you want to generate in the main `text` field.
4.  **Generate:** Queue the prompt. The node will process the text and generate a single audio file.

> [!NOTE]
> **Denoising:** The original VoxCPM library includes a built-in denoiser (ZipEnhancer). This feature has been intentionally removed from the node. The ComfyUI philosophy encourages modular, single-purpose nodes. For denoising, please use a dedicated audio processing node before passing the `prompt_audio` to this one. This keeps the workflow clean and flexible.

### Node Inputs

*   **`model_name`**: Select the VoxCPM model to use. Official models are downloaded automatically.
*   **`text`**: The target text to synthesize into speech.
*   **`prompt_audio` (Optional)**: A reference audio clip for voice cloning.
*   **`prompt_text` (Optional)**: The exact transcript of the `prompt_audio`. This is **required** for voice cloning.
*   **`cfg_value`**: Classifier-Free Guidance scale. Higher values increase adherence to the voice prompt but may reduce naturalness.
*   **`inference_timesteps`**: Number of diffusion steps for audio generation. More steps can improve quality but take longer.
*   **`normalize_text`**: Enable to automatically process numbers, abbreviations, and punctuation. Disable for precise control with phoneme inputs like `{ni3}{hao3}`.
*   **`seed`**: A seed for reproducibility. Set to -1 for a random seed on each run.
*   **`force_offload`**: Forces the model to be completely offloaded from VRAM after generation.

## üé§ Achieving High-Quality Voice Clones

To achieve the best voice cloning results, providing an accurate `prompt_text` is **critical**. This text acts as a transcript that aligns the sound of the `prompt_audio` with the words being spoken, teaching the model the speaker's unique vocal characteristics.

> [!Warning]
> `prompt_text` is the exact transcript of the prompt_audio. It's not a general description of the voice, nor is it for providing emotional cues. Its job is to create a precise, moment-by-moment alignment between the words being spoken and the sounds being made.

#### 1. **Provide a Verbatim Transcript**
The `prompt_text` must be a word-for-word transcript of the `prompt_audio`. Do not summarize or describe the audio.

-   ‚úÖ **Correct:** `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`
-   ‚ùå **Incorrect:** `A person saying a sentence about a fox.`

#### 2. **Punctuation is Important**
Use accurate punctuation to capture the speaker's intonation. The model learns how the speaker ends sentences, asks questions, or shows excitement.

-   **For a statement:** `This is a great example.`
-   **For a question:** `Is this a great example?`
-   **For excitement:** `This is a great example!`

#### 3. **Match Audio and Text Length**
The audio clip should be long enough to capture the speaker's natural pacing and rhythm.

-   üëç **Good:** A 5-15 second clip of continuous, clear speech.
-   üëå **Okay:** A 3-5 second clip.
-   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Very short clips (< 3 seconds) may result in a less stable or robotic-sounding clone.

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ A Voice Chef's Guide

### ü•ö Step 1: Prepare Your Base Ingredients (Content)

First, choose how you‚Äôd like to input your text:
1.  **Regular Text (Classic Mode)**
    *   ‚úÖ Keep **`normalize_text` ON**. Type naturally (e.g., "Hello, world! 123"). The system will automatically process numbers and punctuation.
2.  **Phoneme Input (Native Mode)**
    *   ‚ùå Turn **`normalize_text` OFF**. Enter phoneme text like `{HH AH0 L OW1}` (EN) or `{ni3}{hao3}` (ZH) for precise pronunciation control.

---
### üç≥ Step 2: Choose Your Flavor Profile (Voice Style)

This is the secret sauce that gives your audio its unique sound.
1.  **With a Prompt (Voice Cloning)**
    *   A `prompt_audio` file provides the desired acoustic characteristics. The speaker's timbre, speaking style, and even ambiance can be replicated.
    *   For best results, use a clean, high-quality audio recording as the prompt.
2.  **Without a Prompt (Zero-Shot Generation)**
    *   If no prompt is provided, VoxCPM becomes a creative chef! It will infer a fitting speaking style based on the text itself, thanks to its foundation model, MiniCPM-4.

---
### üßÇ Step 3: The Final Seasoning (Fine-Tuning)

For master chefs who want to tweak the flavor, here are two key spices:
*   **`cfg_value` (How Closely to Follow the Recipe)**
    *   **Default (2.0):** A great starting point.
    *   **Lower it:** If the cloned voice sounds strained or weird, lowering this value tells the model to be more relaxed and improvisational.
    *   **Raise it slightly:** To maximize clarity and adherence to the prompt voice or text.
*   **`inference_timesteps` (Simmering Time: Quality vs. Speed)**
    *   **Lower (e.g., 5-10):** For a quick snack. Perfect for fast drafts and experiments.
    *   **Higher (e.g., 15-25):** For a gourmet meal. This lets the model "simmer" longer, refining the audio for superior detail and naturalness.
